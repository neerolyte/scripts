My perpetually unfinished fork of pacpl.

I wanted to add some features to pacpl including:
 * resumeable conversions
 * repeatable conversions
 * support more codecs
 * recover from "power off" type failures

I managed to add all the features I needed and then ran out of steam to fix the doco and resubmit a patch back to the original author, I've published this "as is" so that it can be reused if someone feels so inclined.
